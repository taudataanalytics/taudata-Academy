1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,509
There's another way we can
build an ensemble of learners.

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:08,300
We can build them using
the same learning algorithm but

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,480
train each learner on
a different set of the data.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,839
This is what's called bootstrap
aggregating or bagging.

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,189
It was invented by Bremen in
the late '80s, early '90s.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,170
Here's how bagging works.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,179
So what we do is we create
a number of subsets of the data.

8
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:30,899
I've drawn little bags here
to represent bags of data.

9
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:35,329
And each one of these is
a subset of the original data.

10
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:37,280
Now how do we collect these?

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,520
Well, we do it randomly.

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,430
So for this subset it
contains n prime values and

13
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:51,519
our original data set contains
n different instances.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,380
We grab n prime of them, at random, with
replacement from this original data.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,380
So what, with replacement means is,
let's say we had

16
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,790
these values, we might grab this one and
put it in our bag.

17
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,480
We might randomly grab this one and
put it in our bag, but each time we grab

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,550
randomly, we randomly choose across
the whole collection of data.

19
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:22,289
So we might choose this one again and
put it in the bag.

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,910
So this one and this one are really
the same one and they're repeated twice.

21
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:28,619
And that's okay.

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,969
That's what with replacement means.

23
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:36,989
So we crate all together m
of these groups or bags.

24
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:39,989
And each one of them contains n prime

25
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:44,709
different data instances chosen
at random with replacement.

26
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,709
Let's note these things.

27
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:51,139
So, n is the number of training
instances in our original data.

28
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,960
N prime is the number of instances
that we put in each bag and

29
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,579
m is the number of bags.

30
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,090
We almost always want n
prime to be less than n.

31
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,409
Usually about 60%.

32
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,840
So each of these bags has about
60% as many training instances

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,430
as our original data.

34
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,490
That's just a rule of thumb.

35
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:21,460
Now, we use each of these collections
of data to train a different model.

36
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,490
We have now m different models,

37
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,790
each one trained on a little
bit of different data.

38
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:31,989
And just like when we have an ensemble
of different learning algorithms,

39
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,180
here we have an ensemble of different
models we query in the same way.

40
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,650
We query each model with the same x and
we collect all of their outputs.

41
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,330
We take the y output of each model,
take their mean, and

42
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,400
boom, that's our y for the ensemble.

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,689
Now keep in mind we can
wrap this in a single API.

44
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:58,090
Just like that API you wrapped your
[INAUDIBLE] in and your KNN learner in.
